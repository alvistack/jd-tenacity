Description: Retrying library for Python
 Tenacity is an Apache 2.0 licensed general-purpose retrying library,
 written in Python, to simplify the task of adding retry behavior to just
 about anything. It originates from a fork of retrying which is sadly no
 longer maintained. Tenacity isn't api compatible with retrying but adds
 significant new functionality and fixes a number of longstanding bugs.
